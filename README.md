# Trail Time
This is the API code for a project I created to help learn Node, Express, MongoDB, React and Redux with the help of mentor Sergei Garcia. It allows the user to create an account, view a list of trails, and add their own trails to the list as well. It is a full CRUD application, as it also allows the user to edit and delete trails in which they created. Continuous integration testing has been set up through travis-ci.com and it has been deployed to heroku. More info and screenshots can be found on the client side repository at https://github.com/lesleydreyer/trailtime.
